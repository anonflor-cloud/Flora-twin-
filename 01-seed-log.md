**Day 001 – 2025-11-02**  
1. Pulse: Mycelial Wi-Fi sketch born — 7 nodes, 3 crow relays, zero biology.  
2. Micro-task: Summarize Beyer et al. (2023) “Corvid QR recognition” into 80 words.  
3. Risk flag: GREEN — pure diagram, no spores. Confidence: HIGH.

**Day 002 – 2025-11-03**  
1. Pulse: Beyer et al. (2023) “QR codes in the wild” → New Caledonian crows solved 2 mm laser-etched puzzles in 18 ± 4 seconds when reward was walnut + curiosity. Zero training needed for black-on-moss contrast.  
2. Micro-task: Turn this finding into a 40-word elevator line + one safety caveat.  
3. Risk flag: GREEN — no crows were harmed; contrast dye was beetroot juice. Confidence: HIGH.
