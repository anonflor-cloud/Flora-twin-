**Day 001 – 2025-11-02**  
1. Pulse: Mycelial Wi-Fi sketch born — 7 nodes, 3 crow relays, zero biology.  
2. Micro-task: Summarize Beyer et al. (2023) “Corvid QR recognition” into 80 words.  
3. Risk flag: GREEN — pure diagram, no spores. Confidence: HIGH.

[ ] Human sign-off: ___________ (Flora)

2. Micro-task: Turn this finding into a 40-word elevator line + one safety caveat.  
3. Risk flag: GREEN — no crows were harmed; contrast dye was beetroot juice. Confidence: HIGH.
